# Blueprints Visual Scripting for Unreal Engine

This repository contains projects and examples created while studying **Blueprints Visual Scripting for Unreal Engine** by Brenden Sewell. The book provides a comprehensive guide to building professional 3D games using Unreal Engine 4's visual scripting system, Blueprints. Through hands-on projects, I learned how to create interactive gameplay mechanics, design AI-driven enemies, and develop user interfaces, all without writing a single line of code.

## Key Skills and Concepts Covered

- **Object Interaction with Blueprints**: Learned how to create and manipulate objects in a level, change materials dynamically, and implement basic interactions using Blueprints.
- **Enhancing Player Abilities**: Extended the default first-person shooter template to add sprinting, zooming, and sound/particle effects for a more immersive experience.
- **Creating Screen UI Elements**: Designed and implemented a HUD (Heads-Up Display) to track player stats such as health, stamina, ammo, and objectives using Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG).
- **Gameplay Constraints and Objectives**: Added constraints to player actions (e.g., stamina drain, ammo limits) and created collectible objects and win conditions to structure the gameplay.
- **AI-Driven Enemies**: Built intelligent enemies using Unreal Engine's AI tools, including Behavior Trees, Blackboards, and AI Controllers. Implemented patrol, chase, and attack behaviors.
- **Advanced AI Features**: Enhanced enemy AI with sound detection, investigation behaviors, and wandering patterns. Also, made enemies destructible and added a system to spawn new enemies during gameplay.
- **Game State Management**: Implemented game states such as player death, round-based progression, and save/load functionality to create a complete game loop.
- **Optimization and Publishing**: Learned how to optimize graphics settings and package the game for distribution.

## Projects

1. **First-Person Shooter Prototype**: A basic FPS game with moving targets, player controls, and a functional HUD.
2. **AI-Driven Enemies**: Enemies that patrol, chase the player, and respond to sound cues. Includes a spawning system to increase difficulty over time.
3. **Gameplay Constraints and Objectives**: A game with collectible ammo packs, stamina management, and a win condition based on eliminating targets.
4. **UI and Game State Management**: A fully functional HUD, pause menu, and win/lose screens with round-based progression.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Unreal Engine 4**: Used for game development, leveraging its Blueprints Visual Scripting system.
- **Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG)**: For creating and managing user interfaces.
- **Behavior Trees and Blackboards**: For designing AI behaviors and decision-making logic.
- **Particle Effects and Sound**: Added visual and auditory feedback to enhance gameplay.
